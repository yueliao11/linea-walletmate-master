# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network lineaSepolia
LineaAdvisor deployed to: 0x4b2f2583B3730820D0A8F2076e3a90Af26872B99
```
